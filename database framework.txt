Here is the framework and requirements for the database system based on the team's discussion:

**1. Technology & Environment**
*   **Platform**: The project will transition to **Google Firebase** as the database solution, moving away from MongoDB which was used in the team's previous projects,.
*   **Cloud Deployment**: The database will be cloud-hosted rather than running locally on a personal computer. This ensures that the data and user progress remain accessible to the frontend and backend 24/7, even when team members turn off their devices.
*   **Resource Allocation**: To manage potential costs from data storage and AI API usage, the database will be linked to Yin Jia's Google Cloud account, utilizing $300 in free credits,. 

**2. Data Modeling & Schema Design**
The database developer (Jia Qian) is tasked with creating a "database manual" (Data Schema/Model). This manual defines exactly how data is structured in JSON format so the backend knows how to interact with it,,.
*   **User Entities**: The database will store basic user profiles, including details like email, name, and avatar. 
*   **Auto-generated IDs**: A critical rule is that every user must have a unique `userId`. This ID must be automatically generated by Firebase rather than manually created, preventing duplication errors that could crash the entire database,.
*   **Nested Folder Structure**: To keep data organized, progress should be nested. For example, instead of having individual records floating around, all country-specific quiz progress (e.g., Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia) should be grouped under a single master directory called `country_progress`.
*   **Variables and Default Values**: The schema must strictly define the data types and their default states. Examples discussed include:
    *   `highest_score`: A numerical value that defaults to 0 if the user is new.
    *   `last_quiz_time`: Uses a constant `now` function to stamp the exact current time.
    *   `total_attempt`: Calculates dynamically by adding `1` to the previous attempt count.
    *   `stamp_collected`: Acts as an achievement tracker. If a user scores above 80, the database records the pass date; otherwise, it remains empty or null,.

**3. Integration & Data Workflow**
*   **Backend as the Middleman**: The database never talks directly to the frontend. It relies on the backend to process incoming `request bodies` (which contain data like `score` and `total_question`) and specific URL variables (`slugs` like a country name). The schema must align with these backend requirements so the backend knows exactly which "drawer" to open and update,,,.
*   **Mock Data Generation**: Because the frontend and backend are being built simultaneously, a major priority for the database framework is generating fake "mock data". This allows the AI models and the frontend interface to be tested without needing real user inputs right away.
