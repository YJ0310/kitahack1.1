## Feedback Set 1

**From:** Lim Wei Jie  
**Faculty:** Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology (FSKTM)  
**Subject:** Feedback on Teh Ais – Cross-Disciplinary Team Matching Platform

Hi,

I just tried out the Teh Ais platform and here are my thoughts.

Compared to using WhatsApp or Facebook groups to find teammates, I think this platform is definitely more convenient in certain ways. In WhatsApp groups, messages get buried very quickly and you have to scroll through dozens of unrelated conversations just to find someone looking for a teammate. Here, the AI matching feature filters people based on skills and interests, which saves a lot of time. However, I do think WhatsApp is still faster for casual, last-minute team-ups since everyone already has it on their phone. If Teh Ais could send push notifications or integrate with WhatsApp somehow, it would be the best of both worlds.

For the profile page, I could roughly tell what needed to be filled in — things like name, skills, faculty, and maybe a short bio. The layout was fairly intuitive, though I wasn't sure whether the "tags" section referred to programming languages, soft skills, or both. A few placeholder examples or tooltip hints would help new users understand what kind of information to put there.

On the homepage, the section that felt the most cluttered to me was the area around the AI assistant and the insight cards. There are quite a few buttons and cards competing for attention, and I wasn't immediately sure which one to click first. The "Browse Teams" and "Create Team" buttons could be made more prominent — maybe with a larger card or a different colour — because those are probably the actions most users want to take right away. Overall, I think a slightly simpler layout with clearer visual hierarchy would go a long way.

One more thing — the dark mode looks really nice, but some of the text contrast on the insight cards could be improved. A few labels were hard to read against the dark background.

Thank you for building this! It has a lot of potential.

Best regards,

**Subject:** User Feedback – Teh Ais Teammate Finder

Hi there,

I was asked to try out the Teh Ais website and share my experience, so here goes.

Honestly, I think this is more convenient than using WhatsApp or Facebook groups — but only once you understand how the platform works. In Facebook groups, I usually just post "looking for teammates for XYZ hackathon" and wait for replies, which is simple but very hit-or-miss. Teh Ais actually tries to match you with people who have complementary skills, which is something social media cannot do. The downside is that there is a learning curve; I spent a few minutes figuring out where to go and what to click. If there were a short onboarding tutorial or a "Getting Started" pop-up for first-time users, it would help a lot.

The profile page was mostly clear. I could see fields for my name, university info, and skill tags. What confused me slightly was whether I should list skills I already have or skills I want to learn — the wording could be a bit more explicit. Also, as an Arts student, I wasn't sure if my skills (like video editing, creative writing, or event planning) would be relevant tags in the system, since the existing tags seemed more tech-focused. It would be great to see a wider variety of non-technical skill tags available.

As for the homepage, the part that felt most confusing was the bottom section with the recommended users and the event cards. Everything was stacked quite closely together, and I couldn't immediately tell the difference between "Recommended for You" and "Upcoming Events." The AI insight cards at the top were interesting, but the action buttons on them (like "View") didn't always seem to do something obvious when I clicked. I'd suggest making the cards more interactive — maybe showing a preview or expanding with more detail on tap.

Apart from that, I also noticed the upload button on the sidebar didn't seem to respond when I clicked it, so I wasn't sure if it was a feature still in development or if something went wrong on my end. Overall, the concept is great and I can see this being really useful once it's more polished!

Kind regards,

## Feedback Set 3

**From:** Tan Chee Hong  
**Faculty:** Faculty of Engineering (FoE)  
**Subject:** Teh Ais Platform – My Feedback

Hello,

Thanks for letting me test the Teh Ais platform. Here is my feedback on the three questions and some additional thoughts.

I think Teh Ais is more convenient than WhatsApp or Facebook groups for finding teammates, especially for cross-faculty collaboration. Normally, engineering students only know other engineering students, so when we need someone with design or business skills for a hackathon, we have no idea where to look. Posting in random Facebook groups feels awkward and you never know who will reply. This platform solves that problem by showing you people from different faculties who have the skills you need. The AI-powered matching feels like a big step up. That said, the platform would benefit from showing more user activity — like when someone was last online — so you know if the person is still active and likely to respond.

The profile page was straightforward enough. I understood I needed to fill in my personal details and select skill tags. The tag selection was decent, though I'd love to see engineering-specific tags like CAD, MATLAB, circuit design, or mechanical drafting alongside the software ones. One suggestion: it would be nice if the profile showed a "looking for" section where I can state what kind of teammates or projects I'm interested in, rather than only showing what I can offer.

On the homepage, the layout that confused me the most was the AI command box area. I typed something into it but wasn't sure if it actually did anything at first — there was no loading indicator or clear confirmation. The insight cards above it were nice but felt a bit generic; I'd prefer if they were more personalised to my profile (for example, suggesting specific hackathons related to engineering). The navigation overall was okay, but I accidentally clicked on a few links that seemed to lead nowhere, which made me think some features were still under construction. A simple "Coming Soon" label on unfinished features would manage expectations better.

One additional piece of feedback: the responsive design worked well on my laptop, but when I tried it on my phone browser, some elements overlapped and the sidebar was hard to access. Mobile responsiveness would be important since most students browse on their phones.

Overall, great concept and I look forward to the finished product!

Cheers,
